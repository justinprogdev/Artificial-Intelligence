# Machine Learning
Simple tutorial/course-work based ML projects demonstrating basic algorithms and methodologies in python. 

## Decision trees
Added a notebook to demonstrate the use of scikit-learn TreeClassifier on the iris data set. 
The tree classifier then builds a decision tree to predict the class of iris based on petal dimensions. 
Subsequently, it predicts the probability of iris class and outputs the dimensions.  
TODO: Will be updating throughout the week of 10/30

## Support Vector Machines  
TODO: Will be updating by 11/7  

### Note
All .ipynb files should run directly in your browser if uploaded into collab. 
Otherwise the notebook will run in VS Code, or Jupyter Notebook.
try it out on your own, if you haven't done it. There are many nice tutorials!
