# Tic Tac Toe Game

This script implements a Tic Tac Toe game. The game is played on a 3x3 board and two players take turns marking
a square with their symbol (either 'X' or 'O'). The game ends when one player gets three of their symbols in a row,
column, or diagonal, or when the board is full and no player has won.

## To Play:

### Train the bot  

Enter the number of training cycles for the bot to train (My laptop bogs at 250000).
I provided no validation, dumb inputs will break. 

### Play the game

Once training is complete, the bot should play moves that it was rewarded for during training

### Have fun
