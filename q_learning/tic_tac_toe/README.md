# Tic Tac Toe Game

This script implements a Tic Tac Toe game. The game is played on a 3x3 board and two players take turns marking
a square with their symbol (either 'X' or 'O'). The game ends when one player gets three of their symbols in a row,
column, or diagonal, or when the board is full and no player has won.

## TODO

- Wire up 2 bots with Q learning models to play against each other. (Not implemented yet)
