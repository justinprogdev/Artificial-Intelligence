# Artificial Intelligence Project Categories 
Each folder is one of these categories

## Machine Learning ðŸ¦¾ 
Machine learning projects based on my course work, and obsessive tinkering.

## First Order Logic ðŸ§ 
Use FOL to create reasoning in your AI
A playground to try out First Order Logic: https://swish.swi-prolog.org/example/houses_puzzle.pl
First order logic is good for reasoning, but less known/popular type of AI

## Mesa models ðŸ¤–
Mesa Models are Agent based models for simple agent scheduling and interaction. Artificial Intelligence. 
An easy tutorial: https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/intro_tutorial.html

## Q-Learning
Q- Learning is a Type of Reinforcement Learning
In this category I use GYM, Python, and Tkinter to build a Tic Tac Toe game and train an agent to play against. 
A nice github repo from openai, Gym (of course it's replaced by gymnasium now): https://github.com/openai/gym   

## Fuzzy Logic
Fuzzy models a "crisp" or well defined input into a fuzzy model, to yield a crisp result
For example if you tell me it's 92.5 degrees outside, I don't say "wow, it's 92.5 degrees." I say it's HOT. 
Hot is a fuzzy category of a crisp input. I don't go to the beach only when it's 92.5, I go when it's hot.
So a crisp output could be, The beach is busy. Google fuzzy logic/models AI.

## Natural Language
My Natural Language folder is a work in process, where I am building a career counselor chat bot.
I'll try to throw some academic context in there as well.

# About 
This contains markdown and yaml for the tech I've used in the repo. 
Make sure to take a look to understand the languages and tools I've used..
